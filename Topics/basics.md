# Basics 
*1 week*

**Basic Maths** :
- [ ] Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide 2 numbers (decimal and binary) :
    - [ ] Represented as strings
    - [ ] Represented as linked lists
    - [ ] Represented as arrays
- [ ] Calculate `sqrt(x)`, `pow(x)` without using inbuilt `sqrt` and `pow` functions
- [ ] Digit rotation problems :
    - [ ] Rotate digits of a given number by K
- [ ] Reverse a number (decimal and binary)
- [ ] Integer to Roman number and vice versa
- [ ] Pascal's Triangle
- [ ] Base conversions :
    - [ ] Decimal to binary, octal and hex
    - [ ] Binary to decimal, octal and hex
    - [ ] Octal to binary, decimal and hex
    - [ ] Hex to binary, decimal and octal
    - [ ] Decimal to other bases (including negative bases)
- GCD of two numbers :
    - [ ] Basic Euclidean Algorithm
    - [ ] Extended Euclidean Algorithm

**Basic Bit Manipulation** :
- XOR Facts :
    - Is associative : ((a XOR b) XOR c) = (a XOR (b XOR c))
    - Is commutative : ((a XOR b) XOR c) = ((b XOR a) XOR c)
    - Is its own inverse (self-inverting): inverse(XOR) = XOR
    - So, `if a XOR b = c, then c XOR a = b and c XOR b = a`.
    - Useful in problems like :
        TODO

- XOR Tricks :
    - `x & (x-1)` : Set the rightmost bit to 1. If this = 0, then the number is a power of 2

- Left and Right Shifts
- Finding MSB
- Alternate bit pattern
