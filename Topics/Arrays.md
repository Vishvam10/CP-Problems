# Basics

## Subarray :
1. Optimization Problems :
    - [ ] Largest sum contiguous subarray
    - [ ] Find the subarray with least average
    - [ ] Smallest subarray with sum greater than a given value
    - [ ] Find maximum average subarray of k length
    - [ ] Count minimum steps to get the given desired array


## k-Order Statistics :
1. [ ] K largest(or smallest) elements in an array 
2. [ ] Kth smallest element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted 2D array
3. [ ] Minimum product of k integers in an array of positive Integers
4. [ ] K-th largest sum contiguous subarray
5. [ ] K maximum sum combinations from two arrays
6. [ ] K maximum sums of overlapping contiguous sub-arrays
7. [ ] K maximum sums of non-overlapping contiguous sub-arrays
8. [ ] Maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent
9. [ ] Maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisions
