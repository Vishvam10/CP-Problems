# CP-Problems

This repo currently has problems from `Leetcode`, `GeeksForGeeks`, `CodeForces`
and `CodeStudio`


## Todo

- `refactor.py` :
    - [ ] Add CLI options 
    - [ ] Selective refactor of files wrt extension (like `.py`, `.cpp`, etc.)
    - [ ] Better CLI and prettify

- `get-commit-message.py` :
    - [ ] Make changes to adapt to the new refactor
    - [ ] Modify existing CLI options 
    - [ ] Better CLI and prettify

- Add semantic commit messages

## In Future

- Linter setup for various languages
- Write a pre-commit hook to trigger refactor, linting, etc.
- Automatically generate `README.md` file based on a template for every problem

## Just a Few More Ideas

- Create a tiny database (using SQLite) to map these problems to its name, tags, difficulty, etc
- Create a CLI (prettified) (or a webapp maybe) for showing stats (like number of problems solved, difficulty split, etc)
