class Solution:
    # IDEA :  Shifting adds up for every index

    #   Mark the beginning and ending of every range
    #   Instead of iterating through the range, we can
    #   add a +1 if we are moving forward in the beginning
    #   of the range and -1 in the end of the range. If we
    #   are moving backward, then -1 at the beginning
    #   and +1 at the end.

    #   Now do prefix sum on this.

    #   pre[i] is how many times we have to increase or
    #   decrease the s[i] char.

    #   NOTE : ord returns the unicode code of a character.
    #        a in unicode is 97 a simple %26 won't work
    #        So, it should be changed to : (ord(ch)-97)%26
    #        (which gives us a number between 0 and 25)
    #        Then add 97 to it to convert it back to
    #        unicode : ((ord(ch)-97)%26) + 97

            if d == 0:
                pre[start] -= 1

        # for i in range(1, len(pre)) :
